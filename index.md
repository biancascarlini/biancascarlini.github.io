## About

I am a 2nd year PhD student at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/). I am part of the [Linguistic Computing Laboratory](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/) team led by prof. [Roberto Navigli](http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/). My main research focus is in **Multilingual Lexical Semantics** and I am currently interested in Word Sense Disambiguation and building novel multilingual semantic representations. Get in touch with me through my social media channels linked on this page!
